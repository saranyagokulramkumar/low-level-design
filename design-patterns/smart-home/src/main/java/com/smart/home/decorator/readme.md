**Decorator design pattern**

In a smart home system, devices like lights and fans have basic functionality (turnOn, turnOff). Using the Decorator Pattern, we can dynamically add new behaviors, such as:
1.	Scheduling when a device should turn on or off.
2.	Monitoring the energy consumption of a device.
